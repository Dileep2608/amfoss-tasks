INSTALL UBUNTU-20.04.3 [ LTS Version] Desktop

Installing ubuntu is not really a tough task. Now l will describe my journey in installing ubuntu.
I have a old desktop computer with 2GB RAM, 150 GB HDD, INTEL PENTIUM PROCESSER. It is currently running on WINDOWS 7.
Even though it won't work effectively, I wanted to dual boot this computer with Linux os Ubuntu ,along with windows 7.

I found the difference between normal version and LTS version which is long term service version. LTS versioin provides a long term service of around 4 years, where as normal version provides service of 1 year.

From the ubuntu website i downloaded the ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS version file which is around 3.07GB.

[Download Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/#download)

Then I started searching for how to dual boot ubuntu in youtube , then I found a [video](https://youtu.be/K36A3HpEKEw)

I followed the video as it is . And I didn't encounterd any problem anywhere throughout the process.
Even in am very low-end pc it runs good.
After using linux for around 1 week I really loved it . Ubuntu is a great platform to learn Computer Science..........
